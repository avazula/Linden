- - - Garden Manager - - - 

This manager is supposed to help gardeners to have the best crop yield on their parcel.
This takes into account the species, the season, the treatments that are needed for the plants to be healthy.

There will be an generic (abstract) class that will define a supertype Plant, then there will be the derived 
classes Fruit, Vegetable, Herb and Legume. 
In the first instance, we will consider that the derived classes will have only one pertinent type of treatment.
This will be done by overriding the pure virtual function treatment from the class Plant.

These classes will create plants that will have a _name_, a period when it is best to sow it _indoors_, one period
when it is best to sow _outdoors_, and a period when it is best to _harvest_. 
These periods will be managed with arrays of 12 boolean: if it is good to apply this property on this month, the 
boolean variable will be equal to 1, 0 otherwise.
The data about the plants will be stored in a XML file.

The software will be developed in such a way that the gardener will be able to research information in two 
different ways:

- He/she can either look after data about one specific plant by specifying its name in the search engine,
- Either look for a month and then there will be displayed all the plants on which something can be done during
that month.
